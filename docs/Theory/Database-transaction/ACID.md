# ACID



## wikipedia [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID)

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), **ACID** ([atomicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)), [consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistency_(database_systems)), [isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)), [durability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durability_(database_systems))) is a set of properties of [database transactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction) intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps. In the context of [databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database), a sequence of database operations that satisfies the ACID properties (which can be perceived as a single logical operation on the data) is called a *transaction*. For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction.
